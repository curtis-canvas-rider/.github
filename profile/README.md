<h2>Purpose of Canvas Rider</h2>
<p>Canvas Rider is a browser-based game that allows players to ride a bicycle on 2D tracks drawn by other users. The goal is to provide an accessible, creative platform for physics-based bike riding and community-driven level sharing using only JavaScript and HTML5.</p>

<h2>Main Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Thousands of user-generated tracks to ride: from simple terrain to complex obstacle courses.</li>
  <li>Ability to design and submit your own tracks - you draw the course and then ride on it.</li>
  <li>Simple controls: arrow keys (pedal, brake, balance), making the game easy to start but difficult to master.</li>
  <li>Physics-based ragdoll-style bike and rider movement for realistic (or hilariously unrealistic) results.</li>
  <li>Runs directly in modern web browsers without additional downloads - purely HTML5 & JavaScript.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Unique Aspects</h2>
<p>Canvas Rider stands out by combining community creativity and physics-based gameplay in a lightweight browser format. The fact that tracks are drawn by players gives virtually unlimited variety and replayability. Also, being HTML5-based means it's accessible on most devices with a web browser, no installation required.</p>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Canvas Rider appeals to casual gamers, retro-game enthusiasts, physics-game fans, and creative players who enjoy designing and sharing levels. It's also good for anyone looking for a quick and fun browser-based game without the friction of installs or heavy system requirements.</p>

<h2>Advantages of Using Canvas Rider</h2>
<ul>
  <li>No installation or downloads - just open a browser and start.</li>
  <li>Huge variety of levels thanks to user contributions - diverse difficulty and creative designs.</li>
  <li>Blend of creative drawing and skillful riding - engaging for both creators and players.</li>
  <li>Lightweight and accessible - works on most devices via browser.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Functional Modules</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Track browser - explore tracks by popularity, most played, featured, random, etc.</li>
  <li>Track editor - draw your own bike courses for others to play.</li>
  <li>Bike-riding engine - physics simulation, balance, pedal/brake control, collision detection, ragdoll physics.</li>
  <li>Community sharing & replay - user-generated content sharing and replaying tracks made by others.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Supported Platforms & Technical Requirements</h2>
<p>Canvas Rider runs in modern web browsers supporting HTML5 and JavaScript. There is no need for additional plugins or installation. Any standard desktop or laptop should handle it, as the game was designed to be lightweight and broadly accessible.</p>

<h2>Licensing and Availability</h2>
<p>Canvas Rider is publicly available via its website, canvasrider.com, as a free browser game. However, note that it has been largely superseded by Free Rider HD, which the developers cite as the official successor offering better support and broader device compatibility.</p>

<h2>Typical Use Cases</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Casual gaming - jump into a quick bike run on a fun custom-made track.</li>
  <li>Creative expression - design and share unique tracks with community.</li>
  <li>Challenge and competition - test skill on difficult tracks, compare times with others.</li>
  <li>Browser-based entertainment - no downloads, just open any compatible browser.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Limitations and Transition</n2>
<p>Canvas Rider is no longer actively updated. Its creators recommend playing Free Rider HD instead, as it is the official successor with more features and ongoing support.</p>
